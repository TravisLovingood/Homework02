Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

First, I will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.

* Using Bootstrap, I created a portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
